            <p>The concept of a ‚Äú20 year cycle‚Äù has existed for years, a frequent talking point in pop culture circles often employed to explain the resurgence of a fashion style or entertainment phenomenon. Though a widely accepted concept, there is a glaring lack of scientific literature that explains or even proves the existence of trend cycles. The science and psychology of music have become increasingly subject to dedicated scholarship, but no academic literature so far exists providing an evidential and logical explanation for trend cycles. My thesis sought to amend that issue, employing close readings of psychology literature, review of longitudinal chart data, and music analysis of popular songs to present evidence for the existence of a sonic trend cycle in music and the factors that drive it. Links to interactive mashups in a virtual mixer for three of the five song pairs I used in the musical analysis segment of my methodology are linked above. Each song is split into a respective vocal and instrumental audio stem file, which have all been titled and embedded into the virtual mixer. Press the play button, and all four files will play simultaneously. Volume control for each audio stem is the vertical slider in each column with the white knobs. The other knobs aren‚Äôt relevant, but control special effects. The red vertical slider in the fifth column is the master volume. I hope you find this interesting, enjoy :)
